# Minishell

## Project Structure
1. File structure
- headers are in "includes", source files are in "src", Makefile is in the root dir.
- libft has it's own separate, but similar structure.
2. Header file
- functions are arranged alphabetically of their function **name**, not function **type**. *(let me know your preference)*
3. Libft functions
- I only include functions that are being used for the project so that it'll be less clustered.
- Currently all libft functions unmodified. If I modify any, I'll add a "_bonus" to the file and function name. *(let me know your preference)*
    *but I'll try to work with the original libft as much as I can.
